IP-ARRAY README


What is IP-Array?
	IP-Array is a command-line program (you may also say `script') written for bash
	(the bash shell www.gnu.org/software/bash).
	It's purpose is to configure IPv4 firewalling and traffic shaping of a linux host.
	To achieve this, IP-Array modifies the linux kernels netfilter / traffic control
	subsystems via the userspace tools iptables / ipset / tc.
	It also allows to load and / or unload netfilter related kernel modules and
	configure the kernel using the sysctl program.

	Intended Audience: Advanced End Users, System Administrators.

	Field of application: From a single host system to a multi-homed router or gateway.

	IP-Array is currently hosted at sf.net.
