tcp_retries1 - INTEGER
This value influences the time, after which TCP decides, that
something is wrong due to unacknowledged RTO retransmissions,
and reports this suspicion to the network layer.
See tcp_retries2 for more details.
RFC 1122 recommends at least 3 retransmissions, which is the default.
