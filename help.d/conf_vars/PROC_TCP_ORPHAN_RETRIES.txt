tcp_orphan_retries - INTEGER
This value influences the timeout of a locally closed TCP connection,
when RTO retransmissions remain unacknowledged.
See tcp_retries2 for more details.
The default value is 8.
If your machine is a loaded WEB server,
you should think about lowering this value, such sockets
may consume significant resources. Cf. tcp_max_orphans.
