--- INET PEER SETTINGS
---------------------------------------
The inet_peer_gc_maxtime variable tells the garbage collector how often to pass over
the inet peer storage memory pool during low, or absent, memory pressure.
This value is in effect under the reversed conditions of the inet_peer_gc_mintime in other words.
It works exactly the same as the inet_peer_gc_mintime, except for the fact that it will be
in effect under different system loads. This variable is measured in jiffies.
