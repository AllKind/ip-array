ABC is a way of increasing the congestion window (cwnd) more
slowly in response to partial acknowledgments.  Possible values are:
0  increase cwnd once per acknowledgment (no ABC)
1  increase cwnd once per acknowledgment of full sized segment
2  allow increase cwnd by two if acknowledgment is of two
segments to compensate for delayed acknowledgments.
