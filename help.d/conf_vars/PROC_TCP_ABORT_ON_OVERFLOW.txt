tcp_abort_on_overflow - BOOLEAN
If listening service is too slow to accept new connections,
reset them. Default state is FALSE. It means that if overflow
occurred due to a burst, connection will recover. Enable this
option _only_ if you are really sure that listening daemon
cannot be tuned to accept connections faster. Enabling this
option can harm clients of your server.
