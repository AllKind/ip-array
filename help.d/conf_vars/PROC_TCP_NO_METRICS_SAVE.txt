tcp_no_metrics_save - BOOLEAN
By default, TCP saves various connection metrics in the route cache
when the connection closes, so that connections established in the
near future can use these to set initial conditions. Usually, this
increases overall performance, but may sometimes cause performance
degradation. If set, TCP will not cache metrics on closing connections.
