tcp_rmem - vector of 3 INTEGERs: min, default, max
min: Minimal size of receive buffer used by TCP sockets.
It is guaranteed to each TCP socket, even under moderate memory pressure.
Default: 1 page
default: initial size of receive buffer used by TCP sockets.
This value overrides net.core.rmem_default used by other protocols.
Default: 87380 bytes. This value results in window of 65535 with
default setting of tcp_adv_win_scale and tcp_app_win:0 and a bit
less for default tcp_app_win. See below about these variables.
max: maximal size of receive buffer allowed for automatically
selected receiver buffers for TCP socket. This value does not override
net.core.rmem_max. Calling setsockopt() with SO_RCVBUF disables
automatic tuning of that socket's receive buffer size, in which
case this value is ignored.
Default: between 87380B and 6MB, depending on RAM size.
