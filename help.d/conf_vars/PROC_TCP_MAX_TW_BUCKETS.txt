tcp_max_tw_buckets - INTEGER
Maximal number of timewait sockets held by system simultaneously.
If this number is exceeded time-wait socket is immediately destroyed
and warning is printed. This limit exists only to prevent
simple DoS attacks, you _must_ not lower the limit artificially,
but rather increase it (probably, after increasing installed memory),
if network conditions require more than default value.
