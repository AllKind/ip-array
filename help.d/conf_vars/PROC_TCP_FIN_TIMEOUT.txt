Set FIN timeout - Default: 60 seconds
tcp_fin_timeout - INTEGER
The length of time an orphaned (no longer referenced by any
application) connection will remain in the FIN_WAIT_2 state
before it is aborted at the local end.  While a perfectly
valid "receive only" state for an un-orphaned connection, an
orphaned connection in FIN_WAIT_2 state could otherwise wait
forever for the remote to close its end of the connection.
