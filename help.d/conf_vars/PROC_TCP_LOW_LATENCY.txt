tcp_low_latency - BOOLEAN Default: 0
If set, the TCP stack makes decisions that prefer lower
latency as opposed to higher throughput.  By default, this
option is not set meaning that higher throughput is preferred.
An example of an application where this default should be
changed would be a Beowulf computer cluster.
