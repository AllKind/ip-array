nf_conntrack_events_retry_timeout - INTEGER (seconds) default 15
This option is only relevant when "reliable connection tracking
events" are used.  Normally, ctnetlink is "lossy", that is,
events are normally dropped when userspace listeners can't keep up.
Userspace can request "reliable event mode".  When this mode is
active, the conntrack will only be destroyed after the event was
delivered.  If event delivery fails, the kernel periodically
re-tries to send the event to userspace.
This is the maximum interval the kernel should use when re-trying
to deliver the destroy event.
A higher number means there will be fewer delivery retries and it
will take longer for a backlog to be processed.
