The inet_peer_gc_mintime variable sets the minimum time between garbage collections (gc) passes
in the inet peer storage under heavy memory pressure. If the system is under heavy utilization
and there is a lot of constraints on the memory pool, this timer is used to tell the garbage
collector how often to pass over the memory pool used by the inet peer storage, in jiffies.
The inet_peer_gc_mintime variable takes an integer value and has a default value of 10 jiffies.
This should be a fairly good value for most users and servers.
