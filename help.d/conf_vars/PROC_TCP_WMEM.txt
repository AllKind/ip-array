tcp_wmem - vector of 3 INTEGERs: min, default, max
min: Amount of memory reserved for send buffers for TCP sockets.
Each TCP socket has rights to use it due to fact of its birth.
Default: 1 page
default: initial size of send buffer used by TCP sockets.  This
value overrides net.core.wmem_default used by other protocols.
It is usually lower than net.core.wmem_default.
Default: 16K
max: Maximal amount of memory allowed for automatically tuned
send buffers for TCP sockets. This value does not override
net.core.wmem_max.  Calling setsockopt() with SO_SNDBUF disables
automatic tuning of that socket's send buffer size, in which case
this value is ignored.
Default: between 64K and 4MB, depending on RAM size.
