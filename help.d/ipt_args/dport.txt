dport: Name(s) of the destination port(s)
	Equivalent to --dport|--destination-port.
	Also to be used with the `dccp' and `sctp' matches.
	Multiple ports can be entered by separating the names with a comma (,).
	In that case negation is not valid.  Except the multiport match
	is available, which will invert the whole match.
	If the multiport match is available a maximum of 15 ports can be enterd.
	If multiple ports were entered and `dport' contains the same value,
	the multiport match with the `--ports' option will be used.
	If icmp is used as protocol, the value of dport will be
	interpreted as icmp_type.

	Examples:
		dport=22
		dport=ftp,ssh,1234
		dport=!23
		dport=!31337,12345
