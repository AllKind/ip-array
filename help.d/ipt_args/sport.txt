sport: Name(s) of the source port(s)
	Equivalent to --sport|--source-port.
	Multiple ports can be entered by separating the names with a comma (,).
	In that case negation is not valid.  Except the multiport match
	is available, which will invert the whole match.
	If the multiport match is available a maximum of 15 ports can be enterd.
	If icmp is used as protocol, the value of sport will be
	interpreted as icmp_type.

	Examples:
		sport=22
		sport=ftp,ssh,1234
		sport=!23
		sport=!31337,12345
